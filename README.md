# brainwavemusiclist
This is the code of my final thesis; an alghoritm that uses brainwaves to understand users interests in music and create a musiclist based on their brainwaves.

I've used Neurosky Mindwave 2 for this project. I have taken the scales using the interface of the Neurosky's officialapp sources.

This is a basic alghoritm of scaling your brainwaves and equalizing your scales within each song you listen. Then sorting the musics based on brainwave scales. 

There is 2 scale; focusing ratio and relaxing ratio. So there is 2 list. Focus List't first song is the song that makes you focused most. And the relaxed list first song is the song that makes you relaxed the most

To start scaling with each song I've used an timer.
